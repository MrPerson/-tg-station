changes: 
  - rscadd: "Everything now drifts in space, not just mobs."
  - rscadd: "Mechs are just as maneuverable in space as you are."
  - tweak: "Being weightless now slows movement down by a lot rather than speeding it up. Having your hands full will make movement even slower."
  - rscdel: "Removed spaceslipping (You slipped! x1000)"
  - bugfix: "Jetpacking after being thrown out a mass driver will cancel out your momentum."
  - bugfix: "Shooting a gun causes you to drift the other direction like spraying a fire extinguisher."
